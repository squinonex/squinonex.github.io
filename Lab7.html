            What I Learned From My Mother
        </h1>
        <h3>By Julia Kasdorf</h3>

    </header>

    <p>I learned from my mother how to love
    <p>the living, to have plenty of vases on hand
    <p>in case you have to rush to the hospital
    <p>with peonies cut from the lawn, black ants
    <p>still stuck to the buds. I learned to save jars
    <p>large enough to hold fruit salad for a whole
    <p>grieving household, to cube home-canned pears
    <p>and peaches, to slice through maroon grape skins
    <p>and flick out the sexual seeds with a knife point.
    <p>I learned to attend viewings even if I didn’t know
    <p>the deceased, to press the moist hands
    <p>of the living, to look in their eyes and offer
    <p>sympathy, as though I understood loss even then.
    <p>I learned that whatever we say means nothing,
    <p>what anyone will remember is that we came.
    <p>I learned to believe I had the power to ease
    <p>awful pains materially like an angel.
    <p>Like a doctor, I learned to create
    <p>from another’s suffering my own usefulness, and once
    <p>you know how to do this, you can never refuse.
    <p>To every house you enter, you must offer
    <p>healing: a chocolate cake you baked yourself,
    <p>the blessing of your voice, your chaste touch.
    <p>

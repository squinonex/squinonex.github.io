                <h2>Sebs & I</h2>
                <p>I've been with my boyfriend for a bit more than a year now. He's majoring in computer science and is into fashion & music. We recently started taking the gym seriously in order to get our summer bodies ready. He's my best friend.

                <h2>Graphic Design</h2>
                <p>When I'm not busy with school, I do commission work on the side. This was a smaller commission for a longtime client. He moved to Florida to pursue his rapper career and other business endeavors. I made this poster for his music show.

                <h2>The Gym</h2>
                <p>I've been gym hopping recently because my home gym is beginning to grow old on me. My new favorite is Signature Fitness in Belleville, New Jersey. I got an one day pass but every time I've walked in, there's no one at the desk to check me in so I can walk right in. So I basically have a free gym until someone notices.</p>

                <h2>Cooking</h2>
                <p>My mother is aging and has stopped cooking at home so I had to pick up the slack. She says I cook better than her now, and I believe it. I enjoy making asian recipes, chicken wings, and stew. my least favorite dish to eat is pasta so I don;t really make it but I had some jerk sauce in the fridge and decided to make rasta pasta (pictured above). </p>

                <h2>Teaching</h2>
                <p>I have a sub teaching job now and it's pretty chill. I mostly enjoy teaching fourth to eighth grade. High schoolers are okay, but can get pretty rowdy sometimes. I was with kindergarden for a couple days and it was hell. I love all children though, it was just exhausting. I have a new respect for teachers that have young children of their own, I wonder when they find time for themselves. </p>

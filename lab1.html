        My name is Shanne Quiñones, but I prefer to go by <b>Quincy.</b> I'm from Elizabeth, NJ and am a 4th year Digital Design student here at NJIT, and have developed an interest in UI/IX. I have hopes that this class will help me deepen my understanding of the field. This winter break I visited my family in Cali, Colombia. I try to go every year, and have a ball every time. I brainstormed ideas for my studio project which I am currently storyborading.
